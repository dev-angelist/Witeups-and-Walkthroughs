## DAMN VULNERABLE WEB APPLICATION

Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.

The aim of DVWA is to **practice some of the most common web vulnerabilities**, with **various levels of difficulty**, with a simple straightforward interface. Please note, there are **both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities** with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover as many issues as possible.

### Download

While there are various versions of DVWA around, the only supported version is the latest source from the official GitHub repository. You can either clone it from the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git

Or [download a ZIP of the files](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA/archive/master.zip).

In all exercise you need to activate a proxy (between user's browser and the target app), to intercept, inspect and modify requests and responses. In my case i used **BurpSuite** with **FoxyProxy** extension.
